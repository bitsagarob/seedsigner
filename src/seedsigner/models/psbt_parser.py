    Reads a psbt on behalf of one seed and works out everything the signing flow shows the

    cosigners for multisig), the amount coming in, what is being spent, what comes back as
    change, the fee, where the spend is going, and any OP_RETURN payload.

    Constructing it with a seed parses immediately.

    The parse fully processes the psbt, validates what it can, then stores the organized
    results in the instance attributes (spend_amount, fee_amount, destination_addresses,
    etc.). Note that change_data and change_amount cover EVERY output coming back to this
    seed, including self-transfers to a receive address. The view layer tells the two
    apart by the branch index in the derivation path.

    A psbt is written by an untrusted coordinator. The metadata it carries about keys
    (fingerprints, derivation paths, xpubs) is a claim, not a fact. The onus is on us to
    verify by re-deriving from the signing seed. For multisig, verification depends on the
    user providing a "known good" descriptor (i.e. can be trusted) from which we can
    verify the outputs by deriving from the cosigners' xpubs.

    This class makes the difference visible in its own names:

      claimed_...   coordinator-supplied metadata (fingerprints, derivation paths, xpubs).
                    Safe to read and display; never safe to make a decision on.
      verified_...  a fact this device proved by re-deriving from the signing seed and
                    matching real key material. Only assigned by code that performed that
                    derivation.

    Invariant: no verified_ value is ever assigned from a claimed_ value without an
    intervening re-derivation from self.root or from a user-supplied "known good"
    descriptor.

    The invariant is enforced, not merely documented: a claim that cannot be turned
    into a fact is refused rather than displayed. See RejectCode for the specific
    constructions that have no honest explanation, and RiskWarning for the ones that
    do and are surfaced for review instead.

        Derives the key that sits at the given derivation path below parent_key, reusing

        A derivation path is traversed one level at a time, and two derivation paths that
        begin the same way share those opening levels. Each level reached is stored in the
        cache, so a later derivation running through that level picks it up instead of
        deriving it a second time.

        Entries are keyed on (id(parent_key), derivation_path_so_far) — the path traversed

        these same derivations below each cosigner's xpub in turn.

        Each entry also holds on to the parent it was derived from. id() is only the
        object's address, which Python is free to hand to a new object once the original

        Fix for when fingerprint is missing (defaults to all zeros). Happens when the user
        creates a new wallet in an external coordinator but only provides the xpub
        (fingerprint and derivation path are omitted).

        Filling the missing fingerprints allows SeedSigner to correctly identify inputs /
        outputs that belong to the signing seed.
