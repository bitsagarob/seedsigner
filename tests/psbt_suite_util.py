"""
Loader and expectation table for the vendored `psbt_faker` adversarial PSBT corpus.

See `tests/data/psbt_test_suite/PROVENANCE.md` for where the fixtures come from.

Every vector derives from the canonical BIP39 all-zeros test vector, so a single
seed unlocks the whole corpus:

    abandon abandon abandon abandon abandon abandon abandon abandon abandon abandon abandon about

    master fingerprint  73c5da0a
    network             mainnet
    accounts            m/84h/0h/0h, m/49h/0h/0h, m/44h/0h/0h

`VECTORS` records, for each fixture, the trap it sets and the behavior a secure
signer must exhibit. The `expect` field is the *target* behavior, not necessarily
what SeedSigner does today.
